# Courses
Each course has its own folder, where each homeowork will be stored separately. A list of the courses (thus far):
1. **IF 100**: Computational Approaches to Problem Solving
2. **CS 201**: Introduction to Computing

Each course will have its folder created after it being finished, hence no subject will have its code shared during the semester. One can find more information about each course by checking out the [offered undergraduate courses](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/en/education/undergraduate) section of Sabanci's [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/en)'s website.
